      <ul>
	      <li>This place is a home for my psychological dysfunctioning.</li>
	      <li>This is a place where I am in control, with no censorship or manipulation.</li>
	      <li>This is a place where my words don't get mixed up with noise.</li>
        <li>This is a place where I am able to express my own creativity instead of using set colors from i.e. BloatPress blogs.</li>
        <li>This is a privacy friendly website, there are no cookies, JavaScript files or any other bullshit.</li>
        <li>This website is written in HTML, CSS and no proprietary JS is used.</li>
